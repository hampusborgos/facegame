Install all packages with `yarn`, then run backend & frontend together with `yarn:dev`:

    yarn
    yarn dev

You **MUST** put a service account json file with access to the Google Vision API in
the same folder as the `package.json` file. Name the file `vision-service-account.json`.

**This was coded in 25 hours, so not I am not vouching for excellent code quality / architecture**
